# bedroom-pi

This is a project for a "raspified" bedroom.

After building a new bed with included speakers and LED lighting, I also
needed something to control them.

The LED light consist of a RGBW neopixel strip, controlled by three Buttons.
One button switches the full strip, the other two switch the outer left
and right section of the strip as a reading light.

The speakers should be driven by a network controllable music player like mpd
or mopidy.

The software runs on an old Raspberry Pi 1 that I had lying around.
